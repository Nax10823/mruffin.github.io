                        where she earned her Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. She was born and raised in Fort Worth, 
                        Texas by a loving family. Over the course of her four years at Spelman she developed a passion for educational
                        technology and seeing others around her protected and succeeding. That is why following her time at Spelman, she 
                        will be transitioning into a full time Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 
                        where her focus will be Security and Privacy.
